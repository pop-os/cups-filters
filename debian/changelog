cups-filters (1.0~b1-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. This is a splitout of all filters which are currently
    being shipped by the "cups" package but are not provided by upstream any
    more. These now have a new home at openprinting.org. Upload to
    experimental for getting it through NEW, then cups and cups-filters will
    be uploaded to unstable in lockstep.
